# **Key Air Pollutants**

**Particulate matter (PM)**

PM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution. There is strong evidence for the negative health impacts associated with exposure to this pollutant. The major components of PM are sulphates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust, and water.

**Carbon monoxide (CO)**

Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless toxic gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, charcoal, natural gas, and kerosene.

<b>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</b>

Ozone at ground level – not to be confused with the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere – is one of the major constituents of photochemical smog and it is formed through the reaction with gases in the presence of sunlight.

<b>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)</b>

NO<sub>2</sub> is a gas that is commonly released from the combustion of fuels in the transportation and industrial sectors.

<b>Sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</b>

SO<sub>2</sub> is a colourless gas with a sharp odour. It is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulphur.

# **Key facts**

- Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risks to child health
- In 2019, 99% of the world’s population was living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met.
- The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually.
- Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019.
- Policies and investments supporting cleaner transport, energy efficient homes, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management would reduce key sources of outdoor air pollution. Access to clean household energy would also greatly reduce ambient air pollution in Africa.

# **Impacts on health (WHO 2025)**

## Ambient Air Pollution

Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting everyone in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.

Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2019; this mortality is due to exposure to fine particulate matter, which causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers.

WHO estimates that in 2019, some 68% of outdoor air pollution related premature deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke, 14% were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 14% were due to acute lower respiratory infections, and 4% of deaths were due to lung cancers.

People living in low- and middle-income countries disproportionately experience the burden of outdoor air pollution with 89% (of the 4.2 million premature deaths) occurring in these areas. The latest burden estimates reflect the significant role air pollution plays in cardiovascular illness and death.

## Household Air Pollution

Each year, 3.2 million people die prematurely from illnesses attributable to the household air pollution caused by the incomplete combustion of solid fuels and kerosene used for cooking. Particulate matter and other pollutants in household air pollution inflame the airways and lungs, impair immune response, and reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

Among these 3.2 million deaths from household air pollution exposure:

- 32% are from **ischaemic heart disease:** 12% of all deaths due to ischaemic heart disease, accounting for over a million premature deaths annually, can be attributed to exposure to household air pollution.
- 23% are from **stroke:** approximately\*\* 12% of all deaths due to stroke can be attributed to the daily exposure to household air pollution arising from using solid fuels and kerosene at home.
- 21% are due to **lower respiratory infection:** exposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood LRI and is responsible for 44% of all pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years old.  Household air pollution is a risk for acute lower respiratory infections in adults and contributes to 22% of all adult deaths due to pneumonia.
- 19% are from **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):** 23% of all deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults in low- and middle-income countries are due to exposure to household air pollution; and
- 6% are from **lung cancer**: approximately 11% of lung cancer deaths in adults are attributable to exposure to carcinogens from household air pollution caused by using kerosene or solid fuels like wood, charcoal, or coal for household energy needs.

Household air pollution accounted for the loss of an estimated 86 million healthy life years in 2019, with the largest burden falling on women living in low- and middle-income countries. 

Almost half of all deaths due to lower respiratory infection among children under 5 years of age are caused by inhaling particulate matter (soot) from household air pollution.

There is also evidence of links between household air pollution and low birth weight, tuberculosis, cataract, nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers.

# **Messages for Governments**

**Policies reducing air pollution**

Addressing air pollution, which is the [second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/total-burden-of-disease-from-household-and-ambient-air-pollution), is key to protecting public health.

Most sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals, and this demands concerted action by local, national, and regional level policymakers working in sectors like energy, transport, waste management, urban planning, and agriculture.

There are many examples of successful policies that reduce air pollution:

- **for industry:** clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas).
- **for energy:** ensuring access to affordable clean household energy solutions for cooking, heating, and lighting.
- **for transport:** shifting to clean modes of power generation; prioritizing rapid urban transit, walking, and cycling networks in cities as well as rail interurban freight and passenger travel; shifting to cleaner heavy-duty diesel vehicles and low-emissions vehicles and fuels, including fuels with reduced sulphur content.
- **for urban planning:** improving the energy efficiency of buildings and making cities greener and more compact, and thus energy efficient.
- **for power generation:** increased use of low-emissions fuels and renewable combustion-free power sources (like solar, wind or hydropower); co-generation of heat and power; and distributed energy generation (e.g. mini-grids and rooftop solar power generation).
- **for municipal and agricultural waste management:** strategies for waste reduction, waste separation, recycling and reuse or waste reprocessing, as well as improved methods of biological waste management such as anaerobic waste digestion to produce biogas, are feasible, low-cost alternatives to the open incineration of solid waste – where incineration is unavoidable, then combustion technologies with strict emission controls are critical; and
- **for health-care activities:** putting health services on a low-carbon development path can support more resilient and cost-efficient service delivery, along with reduced environmental health risks for patients, health workers, and the community. In supporting climate friendly policies, the health sector can display public leadership while also improving health service delivery.

Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges of our time. It comes from a number of different sources and has impacts across several sectors, including health, agriculture and economics. Globally, air pollution is responsible for 8.8 million premature deaths each year, resulting in a reduction of 2.9 years in average life expectancy (Lelieveld et al. 2020), and more than 90 per cent of these air pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa.

As African cities, economies and populations continue to expand, the demand for energy, transport, food and other amenities will also increase. As these resources are some of the leading sources of air pollution on the continent, a corresponding deterioration in air quality is therefore also expected. Furthermore, the challenges presented by rapid urbanization (with the pressure it puts on existing infrastructure, such as waste management systems and transport corridors) and land-use change have the potential to exacerbate air pollution.
