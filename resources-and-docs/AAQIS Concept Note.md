# Introduction

Air pollution poses a critical and escalating threat to public health and the environment in Africa's rapidly urbanizing cities. These urban centres face a unique confluence of challenges, including rapid population growth, the intensifying impacts of climate change, and significant environmental health risks. Such factors exacerbate air pollution and climate-related issues, leading to severe public health impacts and widespread environmental degradation. An integrated information system is crucial to provide the necessary data and tools to address these complex challenges effectively. This system aims to support informed decision-making, enhance urban resilience, and improve overall environmental health by leveraging data science and collaborative frameworks.

The urgency of this system is underscored by alarming statistics. Air pollution in Africa is responsible for approximately 1.1 million premature deaths annually, highlighting the urgent need for improved air quality monitoring and management (Bililign et al., 2024). Accurate observations and sophisticated modelling of meteorology and atmospheric composition are essential for developing effective air pollution mitigation strategies (Bililign et al., 2024).

African cities also grapple with severe urban environmental health challenges, including widespread pollution, declining green spaces, and the urban heat island effect. These issues are further intensified by unplanned urbanization and the pervasive impacts of climate change (Cobbinah, 2023). Climate change specifically intensifies urban environmental health risks, such as heatwaves and floods, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations (Cobbinah, 2023).

Despite the rapid growth of African cities, many lack comprehensive data, making robust resilience planning challenging. Air quality information system can help bridge this critical gap by enabling data-driven decision-making and fostering collaboration between communities and local governments (Spaliviero et al., 2020). Fortunately, leveraging technology for climate adaptation offers significant promise. Data science can be used to map heat risk, predict health outcomes, and establish early warning systems, thereby enhancing climate resilience in cities, particularly within the African context (Jack et al., 2024). Africa Air Quality Information System is designed to facilitate such integrated approaches.

While the development of such a system is essential, tailoring solutions to local needs and ensuring robust community engagement are also critical for the success of any resilience-building initiative. Fostering strong partnerships between local and regional stakeholders can enhance capacity building ensuring sustainable urban development and a healthier future for African urban populations.

# Objectives

The Africa Air Quality Information System (AAQIS) aims to:

1. Improve air quality monitoring in selected African cities,
1. Enhance regional collaboration on air quality management,
1. Empower communities to take action to reduce air pollution,
1. Raise awareness regarding air quality and urban climate resilience.

# Target Audience

The system is strategically designed to cater to a broad spectrum of stakeholders, crucial for effective air quality management and urban resilience. Its primary beneficiaries include air quality practitioners and technical experts, who will leverage its real-time data and analytical tools for technical assessments; policymakers and urban planners, who will rely on the system for actionable intelligence to formulate evidence-based policies and integrate air quality into urban development plans; and community members in the pilot cities, who will be empowered with timely information and alerts to mitigate health risks and engage in local initiatives.

Additionally, the system will serve as a vital resource for researchers and academia for in-depth studies, NGOs and advocacy groups for evidence-based campaigns, and international organizations for tracking progress and fostering regional collaboration, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making, capacity building, and a coordinated approach to addressing air pollution challenges across the continent.

# Key Functionalities

The system provides a robust suite of functions, primarily focused on air quality data management, advanced analytical capabilities, and communication tools and platforms.

1. **Real-time Air Quality Monitoring**

The system will include direct integration with existing monitoring stations, leveraging satellite imagery data for broader spatial coverage, and accommodating data streams from existing data sharing networks (IQ Air, AirQo and sensors.AFRICA) deployed within the three pilot cities. This data acquisition strategy ensures a comprehensive and continuously updated understanding of air quality indicators and meteorological conditions.

1. **Historical Data and Trends Analysis**

The system will store and present historical air quality data for further analysis by the user. This module will enable users to conduct in-depth temporal and spatial analyses, identifying long-term trends, seasonal variations, and anomalous pollution events, based on the data available on the system.

1. **Customizable Alert and Notification System**

To ensure timely dissemination of critical information, the system will incorporate a sophisticated, user-configurable alert and notification mechanism. Users will receive automated alerts through proposed channels. This proactive approach aims to directly engage users, prompting appropriate actions to mitigate exposure during adverse air quality events.

1. **Interactive Data Visualization and User Interface**

A principal component will be a highly intuitive and interactive dashboard, serving as the primary interface for data exploration and system interaction. This platform will offer dynamic visualizations of air quality data, spatial analysis overlays (e.g., heat maps, pollution plumes prioritizing user experience, ensuring accessibility and ease of navigation for diverse user groups, from technical experts to the public.

1. **Knowledge Management and Capacity Building**

The system will serve as a comprehensive repository for policy, legislative, educational, and awareness materials related to air quality and climate resilience. This integrated knowledge hub will host self-paced training modules, best practices, policy briefs. The objective is to enhance the capacity of air quality practitioners, researchers, NGOs, and the broader public, fostering a deeper understanding of air pollution issues and effective mitigation strategies.

1. **Incorporating Public Reporting and Citizen Science**

To augment formal monitoring networks and empower community participation, the system will include a dedicated module for citizen science contributions. This functionality will allow the public and domain experts to report observed air quality events, localized pollution incidents, and other relevant environmental observations directly through the platform, ideally via mobile applications. These geo-tagged observations will be immediately visualized on an interactive map. This crowdsourced data will serve as a valuable complement to sensor data, helping to identify localized pollution hotspots and foster greater community engagement in air quality monitoring and advocacy.

1. **Collaborative Platforms and Coordination Tools**

To foster robust regional coordination and facilitate transboundary considerations in air quality management, the system will host dedicated collaborative environments. This includes an integrated discussion forum, secure document sharing capabilities for policy formulation, and interactive geospatial tools enabling practitioners from different cities and countries to share insights, discuss localized and regional air quality issues, and collaboratively develop harmonized monitoring strategies and policy responses.

# Technical Requirements

The system will utilize a combination of open-source and commercial technologies, for data analysis and visualization, and a cloud-based platform for hosting. Data sources will include national and local governments, existing data initiatives and platforms, monitoring stations, and satellite imagery.
